## How to Execute the Programs
The two programs are created in different languages, algorithm 1 in Python and algorithm 2 in C++. For algorithm 1 make sure that you have python installed, if not refer to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ for the install proces. After verifying it works, open a CMD or PowerShell terminal within the same folder as the Algo_1_Rentals_Project3.py file. Once there, run the command "python Algo_1_Rentals_Project3.py" in the terminal, and you will be prompted with the inputs for the algorithm. Input should look like this: (0,2) (1,4) (4,6) (0,4) (7,8) (9,11) (3,10). Make sure there is no extra space in the (start,end) and no commas after parentheses. After the correct input, you should get an output. For algorithm 2, run the submitted algo2.exe file that has been provided. This will execute the program within a created terminal, prompting the user to input the necessary data for the program to execute the necessary steps and solve the problem. After solving the problem, the program will ask the user if they wish to start again and will loop back to the beginning of the program.
